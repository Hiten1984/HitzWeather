Android weather app created based upon Android Clean architecture that uses various libraries such as Picasso, Retrofit, Butterknife, OkHttp. 


This is just a sample app that uses Android Clean Architecutre for the code structure and separates each entity to do its task.
It consumes Retofit to make asynchronous http call to open weather API.
